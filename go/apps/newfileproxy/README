This is a later and simpler version of fileproxy written after simpleexample.  It reuses
support_libraries/tao_support and the standard sample domain server.
The authorization is also simplified to resemble linux file systems and
does not use the cloudproxy authorization language for file operations.

User name is APPLICATION.
