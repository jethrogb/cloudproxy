This is a later and simpler version of fileproxy written after simpleexample.  It reuses
simpleexample libraries and the standard sample domain server rather than a custom one
(keynegoserver).  The authorization is also simplified to resemble linux file systems and
does not use the cloudproxy authorization language for file operations.

User name is APPLICATION.
