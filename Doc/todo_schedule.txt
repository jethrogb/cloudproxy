Check: key wiping
Change domain program loading:  should a host name be extended by a program loading policy?  The policy
key for the host should almost certainly not have to sign every image that is run.  In a cloud
setting it would kill scale and make the host policy key vulnerable. Check with Tom.

Add additional key certification for binding key?  (Key that seals secrets for another program.)
