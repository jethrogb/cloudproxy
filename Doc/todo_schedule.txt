Todo:

Check: key wiping everywhere especially with errors.

Revise simple example to use acl guard. (july)
Fix policy key generation so it can be exported in a standatd format.
Fix policy enforcement.  It should be loaded in and measured.  Default should be run everything. (july)

Support RSA keys
C++ library for domain support including key serialization stuff?

Replace ToPrincipal and FromPrincipal
Names of keys should be hashes and provided for verification, not for getting keys.

Should the examples force SSL NOT to resume channels etc for better assurance?
